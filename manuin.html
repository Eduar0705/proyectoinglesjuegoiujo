                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Access the Memory Game</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open your web browser.</li>
                            <li>Navigate to the URL where the memory game is hosted (e.g., http://yourwebsite.com/memory).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Once players press the start button, the timer will begin. Each player on the team must select 2 pairs of cards. If correct, they continue; if they fail, a teammate will take their turn.
                            </p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>As they win, they will earn points and advance levels. The higher the level, the greater the difficulty and number of cards.
                            </p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>The game can end in two ways: players complete all levels, thus finishing the game, or they fail, and time runs out.
                            </p>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>Once a team loses or wins, another team should take their turn. The team that wins in the shortest time will be the team with the best brain speed test.
                            </p>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>The cards may contain objects, fruits, emojis, etc. Each time a round progresses or finishes, the cards will be randomly shuffled.
                            </p>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <p>Each time a round ends, a message will appear on the screen indicating that the time is up and asking if they would like to try again. At the bottom, there will be a reset or start game button.</p>
